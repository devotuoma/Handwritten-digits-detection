Explanation of the Code
MNIST Dataset: The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9) and their corresponding labels.

We load the dataset using mnist.load_data().
We normalize the pixel values to the range of 0 to 1 by dividing the images by 255.
Model Architecture:

Input layer: The Flatten layer reshapes the 28x28 image into a 1D vector of 784 features.
Hidden layer: We use a dense (fully connected) layer with 128 neurons and a ReLU activation function for non-linearity.
Dropout: A dropout layer is added to prevent overfitting by randomly setting some of the neurons' outputs to zero during training.
Output layer: The output layer has 10 neurons (for 10 classes) and uses a softmax activation function to return probabilities for each digit.
Compilation: The model is compiled using:

Adam optimizer: Adaptive learning rate method for efficient optimization.
Sparse categorical crossentropy loss: This is suitable since we have integer-labeled classes.
Accuracy metric: To evaluate the model's performance.
Training: We train the model for 5 epochs using the fit() function.

Evaluation: We evaluate the model on the test set using evaluate(), which returns the loss and accuracy.

Prediction and Visualization: After training, we use predict() to make predictions on the test images and display a few examples using matplotlib.

Step 3: Report on Model Performance
Model Performance:
Accuracy: The model achieves a test accuracy of around 98% after 5 epochs of training. This is a strong performance, given the simplicity of the model and the ease of the MNIST dataset.

Loss: The test loss is relatively low, indicating that the model has successfully learned to classify the digits with minimal error.

Observations:
Training vs Test Accuracy: The model might experience some overfitting if the training accuracy is significantly higher than the test accuracy. Adding more regularization techniques (e.g., dropout) or using more advanced architectures could improve performance further.

Visualizations: By displaying the predicted and actual labels, we can visually verify if the model makes reasonable predictions for the test samples.

Suggestions for Improvement:
More Complex Models: Adding more layers or using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) could improve the model's performance, especially for image classification tasks.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Experimenting with different optimizers, learning rates, or batch sizes could improve the model's generalization.
